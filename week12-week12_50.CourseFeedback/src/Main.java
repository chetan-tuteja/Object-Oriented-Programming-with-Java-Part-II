                "some feedback about this course\n");

    /* A very well made course, I have learned so much, the exercises were sometimes really fun
       while other times, it could leave you irritated, but when you finally solved them, it felt so
       great, that feeling is really blissful.

      The part-2 of the overall course got exponentially tough, but the part-1 does a fine job of building
      strong basics, so one can work their way in part-2. 

      Only complaint is that part-2 had some loose translations, in the exercise, so sometimes, it wasn't
      clear what you had to do, TMC helped with that though, precisely telling what more was required or what
      was missing. That could be improved, but otherwise this is just perfect.

     I really wish there were more of these courses, for other subjects or other languages, English Translated
     ones. Hope to see them in future.

     Once again, Thank You for teaching me so much. I'd be grateful all my life :)
